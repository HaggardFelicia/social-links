### What I Learned

- Achieving the desired width for the card container presented significant challenges. I ultimately resolved the issue by employing the following code:

``` css
main{
  @apply w-10/12 mx-auto md:w-1/4;
}
.container{
  @apply max-w-fit mx-auto md:min-w-full;
}
```

### Continued Development

- I want to continue enhancing my skills in the mobile-first approach to coding.
